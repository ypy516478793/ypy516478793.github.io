# About Me

<img src="/assets/images/presentation.jpeg"
width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Houston. I am supervised by [Dr. Hien Van Nguyen][1] in [HULA Lab][8] and co-advised by [Dr. Jiefu Chen][2] in [MODEL Lab][9]. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Meta-Learning, and their applications in Computer Vision and Image Analysis. 

During my Ph.D., I have published 16 research papers[^fnote2] in conference (MICCAI, SEG) and journal: (IEEE-TMI, Geophysics) etc. My goal is to bring the advanced and mysterious AI techniques to solve the real-world problems. I have finished projects in medical field such as Nuclei Detection, Brain Cell Type Classification, and Lung Cancer Screening. There are some other works in geophysics field such as First Arrival Picking, and Seismic Interpolation. For more information about my research or presentations, please check the [Portfolio][10] page.

Along my studies, I interned as the data scientist at [Schlumberger][3] and [Sensia][4], and as the research intern at [Dataminr][5]. I worked on different machine learning projects and tried to solve problems in Anomaly Detection, Automatic Control, and Few Shot Object Detection. My internships also resulted in 2 published WO patents in the oil and gas field.

I have a lot of experience in building machine learning models and studying the mathematical theories. My main programming language is Python, and I am familiar with different machine learning libraries such as Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras, SciKit-Learn, and numerical analysis tools such as Numpy, SciPy, and Pandas.  

I am expected to graduate in 2022, and I am looking for exciting and professional work opportunities. You are welcome to get in touch. To find more information about me, please take a look at my [Resume][6].
