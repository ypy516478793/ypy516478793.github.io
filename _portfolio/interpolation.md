## Abstract

Reconstruction of seismic data in exploration geophysics is an important but challenging task in seismic data processing. Different machine-learning based approaches have been de- veloped to solve this ill-posed problem and achieved great progress. However, most of the available machine-learning tools use supervised learning method where a good training dataset with many complete shot–gathers are required to train the model. Existing unsupervised learning approach based on a generative model is able to reconstruct the general image pat- terns in a shot–gather but fails to accurately resolve the fine features, especially when aliasing is a main concern. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning method that com- bines a blind-trace network and an automatic spectrum sup- pression technique for high-accuracy seismic data reconstruc- tion. We present some examples covering challenging scenar- ios, e.g. a wide range of randomly or regularly decimated seis- mic data, where our method consistently performs accurate re- constructions.
